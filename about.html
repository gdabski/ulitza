            <h3> What is ulitza</h3>
            <p>
                A view into each country's unique history as told by its most
                famous heroes, leaders and poets. How are there warriors telling
                their history in our case? Simple. We find out how each country
                has chosen to name their own streets, squares, public
                institutions and similar landmarks. Among these, we only select
                the ones designating a person name. In short, eponyms. We then
                let each country boast its own list of heroes that have shaped
                its history. All entries have wikipedia links, so we can explore
                in depth.

                In some of the cases, the names reveal strong nationalistic
                tendencies, where the fight for independence plays the leading
                role. In other cases, they bear the scars of outside influences,
                where strong empires have culturally eclipsed its neighbours or
                colonial powers have spread their influence far and wide.

            <h3> Etymology </h3>
            From the Romanian <b>uliță</b>, meaning a narrow road, used most
            frequently for streets in small villages borderd on both sides by
            houses, in contradiction to the city boulevards, for example.

            Originally a proto-slavic word,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ulica">ulita</a>, it has many
            variants in most of the Eastern-Europeean countries and languages,

            <h3> Method and data source </h3>
            <p>
                All data is taken from openstreetmap. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All wikipedia links are to the English pages, if it exists. If
                not, to the language of the country where the eponym appears
                in. The display name is based on the wikipedia entry, and not on
                the name as it actually appears on the streets and
                landmarks. You can check the github page for each country to get
                the raw info.
