        <p>
            Have you ever wondered what the most popular street names in
            your country are? Who were all those men and women you see
            everywhere on street signs? Who does your country consider to be
            its most famous heroes, leaders, poets or artists of the past
            that have had a long lasting influence on the public
            imagination? Or of whatever other country you might have an
            interest in? Great! So did I!
        </p>

        <h4> Method </h4>            
        <p>            
            All street data is taken from 
            <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html">openstreetmap</a>
            (osm). I've parsed it, cleaned it up, sorted it and I've added
            wikipedia links for all such entries that are named after a
            person (eponyms, from now on).
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the osm entries are not always consistent, there is no
            clear separation between names of streets, bridges, squares,
            public buildings, etc. All such landmarks are taken into
            consideration, as long as they are eponyms. So "street names" is
            a bit of a useful lie.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Names of legendary figures, fictional characters (books, plays),
            or tribes have also sometimes been included. 

            To avoid duplicate entries, there is only one name allowed per
            city. Affixes like "street", "boulevard", "square", etc. are
            removed. If more than one name refers to the same person, they
            are considered equivalent and are not counted more than once.
        </p>

        <h4> Page structure </h4>
        
        <p>
            The front page lists the most famous persons worldwide. That is,
            if a person appears at least once in a given country, they
            receive +1. For the country pages, the count refers to the
            number of cities where that name appears at least once. In both
            cases, clicking on the count reveals the countries where that
            persons appears in. The wikipedia articles and the persons names
            are all in English or in the country's own language, as an
            alternative.                
        </p>
        
        <!-- <p>
             The top-write orange number is the total number of unique
             eponyms currently available.

        <p>
            I've had some trouble with arabic text, mostly in the way I'm
            arranging the equivalent names due to right-to-left writing
            direction. Parsing and figuring out eponyms for China,
            Korea and Japan are complete misteries so none of them are
            currently included. Help!
        </p>

            Check out the github page for every country (click on the
            country name) and add, remove or adjust the wikipedia link.

            <h4> Etymology </h4>
            <b>ulitza</b>, a non-standard way of writing <b>uliță</b>, without using any
            special characters, a Romanian word meaning a narrow road, used most
            frequently for streets in small villages borderd on both sides by
            houses, in contradiction to the city boulevards, for example.

            Originally a proto-slavic word,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ulica">ulita</a>, it has many
            variants in most of the Eastern-Europeean countries and languages,
